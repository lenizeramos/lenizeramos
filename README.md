## 👩‍💻 About Me

After over a decade in the legal field, I made a bold pivot into tech — and I’ve never looked back.  
I recently graduated from an intensive Web Development program where I mastered modern tools and frameworks such as:

- 🧠 TypeScript & JavaScript
- ⚡ Next.js & React
- 🎨 HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 
- 🗃️ MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- ☁️ Vercel

My background in law brings a sharp eye for detail, strong documentation skills, and a user-first mindset — qualities I now apply to clean, efficient code.
